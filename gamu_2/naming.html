    Timeline of this setup as far as I can tell:
    <uL>

    <li><a href="https://w.atwiki.jp/tetrismaps/pages/371.html">"Thread/ITO cannon"</a> developed as early as October 2020, with a fixed J placement.</li>

    <li><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/916761188107452446/997841763186253906/unknown.png">Self-admitted</a> <a href = "https://discord.com/channels/147897421169426434/908777682895007744"> plagiarizer</a> </a> writes HD wiki page April 2021, named <a href="https://harddrop.com/wiki/Elite_Stacking">"Elite Stacking,"</a> later renamed <a href="https://harddrop.com/wiki/Mountainous_Stacking">"Mountainous Stacking,"</a> which is exactly the same setup, but with held J for more bag_2 path options.</li>

    <li>"Mountainous Stacking 2" developed, which [makes the same shape as MS1 but with different pieces, to hold L instead] and simultaneously also [is gamu but with shifted I], which has the same hold L.</li>

    <li>A later investigation reveals the plagiarist's actions on this setup (and others).</li>

    <li>Setup is largely popularized under the name Mountainous Stacking 2 when kazu picks it up to use against amemiya <a href="https://youtu.be/YJ9f50hUNV8">in Kemonomichi</a>.</li>

    </uL>

    If you don't feel comfortable giving the plagiarizer anything by keeping their name of "mountainous stacking", some options may be 

    "thread 2" "gamu 2" "shifted I gamu" "new gamu" "new thread" "thread gamu hybrid" "eztd"

    Anyway this is just a page giving information about the history of the naming of this setup to anyone who stumbles upon this page. How anyone chooses to refer to it is up to them.
