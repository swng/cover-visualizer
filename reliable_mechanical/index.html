		<h1>Reliable Mechanical TSD</h1>
        Reliable TSD has various paths. This page is a subset of <a href="../reliable_tsd">this page</a> detailing various paths. Here we will specifically discuss the path that leads into mechanical TSD. For a video example of this in action, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p5kBiYpvh8">see here</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Reliable Mechanical TSD is a continuation path from Reliable TSD opener that leads to Mechanical TSD. It was discovered by Reminder and formalized by swng.

    Bag 1 resembles a TKI shape. Mainly built with early LJ bags. L before S and either J or I before Z. Some spins allow some unintuitive placements for <a href="https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99B843375CF9EB3117">I after J</a> or <a href="https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99162F505CF9ECB013">J after IZO</a> (see KR wiki gifs). 54.44% cover or 64.44% including the mirror.

    Bag 2 uses O and S to setup the TSD and a box with LZJI on the side. ~85% coverage.
    <br>
    Some tips for building a box out of LZJI:
    <br>
    The box consists of a 3x4 LZJ, either vertical or horizontal, and either a vertical I on the left/right or horizontal I on the top/bottom.
    <br>
    For Z between L and J (LZJ or JZL), <a href="https://harddrop.com/fumen/?v115@RgilwhFeglAtg0whFeBtg0whFeAth0whRpHeRpDeh0?AtwhA8CeR4g0BtwhB8AeR4A8g0AtglwhB8BeB8ilwhJeAgH?">you can build a vertical box</a>.
    <br>
    For Z after L and J (LJZ or JLZ), with very early or late I, you can set up a <a href="https://harddrop.com/fumen/?v115@zgRpHeRpFehlA8CeR4g0BeglB8AeR4A8i0glB8BeB8?zhJe89mvhAkif">horizontal box and do a Z spin</a>. Note that J can be spun in after L also. Note again that I needs to come early to be placed at the bottom or late to be placed at the top. If I doesn't come late enough, there exists <a href="https://harddrop.com/fumen/?v115@ogwhIewhRpGewhRpGewhA8CeR4BthlB8AeR4A8g0Bt?glB8BeB8i0glJeAgl">this thing</a>, but it leads to a different board state and you'll have to freestyle after it.
    <br>
    For Z before J and L, for early I or late S, <a href="https://harddrop.com/fumen/?v115@zgRpHeRpEei0A8CeR4AeBtg0B8AeR4A8BeBtB8BeB8?zhJeaHnvhAKnf">you can do a horizontal box and 180 the L</a>.
    <br>
    For ZJL, with late I, you can do a vertical box and <a href="https://harddrop.com/fumen/?v115@zgRpHeRpHeA8CeR4AeAtBeB8AeR4A8BtBeB8BeB8At?Me+NnvhAetBDhilwhFeglBewhIewhIewhJeAAA">tuck the J</a>.
    <br>
    For ZJ and very late L, you can do <a href="https://harddrop.com/fumen/?v115@zgRpHeRpHeA8CeR4i0AeB8AeR4A8Btg0AeB8BeB8Ae?BtKepIJ">this dono</a> and place L after the TSD.
    <br>
    <br>
    85% is NOT 100% so there ARE cases where you simply will not be able to build the box and TSD.

    Bag 3, you build an STSD with SZ and an LOJ box. LOJ box can be built in 2 orientations, LJ on O or O on LJ.
    <br>
    Finesse tips for awkward placements:
    <br>
    Late Z: ccw, sd, cw.  (Mirror case will be slightly different). If you don't know this finesse, the Z may kick in unexpected ways. Be careful to not misdrop in this situation; ensure it's placed correctly before confirming the placement with harddrop.
    <br>
    For a queue such as TIJOZSL where you build box with O above J, but Z is before L, you insert the L with a 180.
    <br>
    For a queue such as TIJOSLZ where you build the box with O above J, and need to tuck the L, you may need to sd the L atop the S, 180, and wait for gravity to do the tuck.

    Bag 4, you set up for mech TSD. 2 setups are provided; setup a is preferred. Coverage is 68.69% and 50% respectively, 74.64% cumulatively.
    <br>
    Essentially - take the TSD, place Z atop it. L goes in the L dependency on the right and I goes in the center to establish the 3 wide gap. Then an S goes on one side and an OJ chipped tooth goes on the other side.
    <br>
    The piece order dependencies for this are a little complicated to describe. Z follows T. Early L has to either precede S or preceded OJ. OJ can be placed on the right with J before O if I has not been placed.

    Bag 5: complete the SL chipped tooth and start the mech TSD pattern. Path a has 63.33% success; path b has 50% succcess. If bag 5 is successful the rest of the 20TSD is 100% guaranteed.

    Bag 6+ mech TSD path. Um, you follow the mech v2 pattern.
    <br>
    You take the TSD in the premade shape and build the float above it for the next bag.
    <br>
    All pieces except S can be placed in any order. Keep S in hold to place later. This pattern can be repeated each bag. It raises the 3wide well by a row each bag. The I spire rises faster than the well, so you may tuck it within the 3wide well on some bags. Again, see <a href="https://tinyurl.com/reliable-mechanical-20-tsd">this fumen</a> for more details.
